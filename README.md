## Pull and Run in Android Studio

To pull and run the Studeezy project in Android Studio, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
- Open **Android Studio**.
- Go to **File > New > Project from Version Control**.
- Select **Git** and enter the repository URL.
- Choose your directory and click **Clone**.

### 2. Open the Project
- Once the project is cloned, Android Studio will open the project automatically.
- If not, you can open it manually by going to **File > Open** and selecting the project folder.

### 3. Sync the Project
- Once the project is open, Android Studio may prompt you to sync the project with Gradle. Click **Sync Now** to download necessary dependencies and libraries.
- **Firebase Integration**: Since Firebase is already set up in the project, syncing will automatically link the app to Firebase services, including Realtime Database, Authentication, etc.

### 4. Set Up the Emulator or Device
- Ensure you have an Android emulator or a physical device connected.
- Go to **Tools > AVD Manager** to set up an emulator, or connect your device via USB and enable developer mode.

### 5. Run the Project
- Select your device or emulator from the target device dropdown.
- Click on the **Run** button (green triangle) in the toolbar.
- The project will build and launch on the selected device.

### 6. Troubleshooting (if needed)
- If there are any issues with Gradle sync or dependencies, you may need to check the **build.gradle** files and ensure that all necessary libraries are included.
- You can also try **File > Invalidate Caches / Restart** if the IDE behaves unexpectedly.
- If Firebase-related services (such as database connections or authentication) are not working, ensure that the `google-services.json` file is correctly placed in the `app/` folder of the project.
